Hi! I'm a developer who mostly works in Python, C, and C++. I'm interested in audio and systems programming.

***

‚≠ê The systems project I'm most proud of is a program I wrote in Python for securing IoT devices on a home router.
The progam runs on a DD-WRT router, and automatically creates IP-Tables rules for IoT devices as they connect to network.

The code is hosted in the repo called [IoT-Security-MUDfile-to-IPTables](https://github.com/GabeIB/IoT-Security-MUDfile-to-IPTables)

I made this project while working at Columbia's Internet Real-Time Lab. You can read my report on the project here: http://gabrielbrown.net/blog/IoTSec1/IRT_final_report.pdf

‚≠ê The audio project I'm most proud of is an additive synthesizer VST that I wrote in C++ using the JUCE framework.
The synthesizer allows the user to create per-partial amplitude envelopes, and lets users programatically generate presets using Python.

For example, I wrote a Python script that generates presets for the synthesizer using a technique called [Oscillator Bank Resynthesis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis#Additive_analysis/resynthesis)

The code is hosted in the repo called [additive_synth](https://github.com/GabeIB/additive_synth)

I made this project while learning at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). You can listen to some sounds I made with this synthesizer here:

I'm looking to work on back-end web development, audio development, and software systems projects. If you'd like to hire me, you can reach me at Gabriel.Brown@columbia.edu
